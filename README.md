<h1>Static Website Project</h1>


<p>The website layout was my own original design. All elements were built from scratch, with very minimal (if any) use of snippets from other programmers. The goal of this project is to ensure my fundamental HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills are at a level that will allow me to start learning react.js effectively.</p>

  <h2>Status: Abandoned</h2>
  
**Lessons Learned**
<ul>
  <li>My class structure for css was a nightmare and it made it very difficult to make minor changes. In the future, I will most likely use SASS and also pay close attention to my class naming and div hierarchies.</li>
  <li>I really got to know HTML and CSS a lot better here and I feel confident that I won't get hung up on future projects with basic UI components.</li>
  <li>This project might have been better to design mobile-first, and I look forward to doing a mobile-first project in the future, probably in react</li>
  <li>My code is messy as hell, and rather than clean it up to try and impress you, I'm just going to make a new project, so stay tuned. That being said, all comments and criticism are welcome!</li>
